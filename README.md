# Telecom Churn Prediction

This repository contains code and models for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry.  The project utilizes various machine learning and statistical techniques to identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.

# Summary

The **eda.ipynb** notebook performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a telecom customer churn dataset to identify patterns, anomalies, and key factors influencing customer churn. The findings are:

 * **Service Agreements:** Monthâ€‘toâ€‘month customers churn more than those on annual/biâ€‘annual plans.

 * **Tenure:** Newer customers show higher churn risk.
 
 * **Charges:** Higher MonthlyCharges and abrupt increases signal churn.
 
 * **Services:** Customers without multiple services (e.g., no internet or security addâ€‘ons) are more likely to churn.
 
 * **Payment Methods:** Electronic check users exhibit elevated churn rates.

# ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The dataset consists of information about 7,043 telecom customers, each represented by 21 features. It captures demographic information, account details, service usage patterns, and whether or not the customer has churned (i.e., left the company).
